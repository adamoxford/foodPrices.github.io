                <p><strong>2021: Pandemic pressures and weather challenges</strong>
                </br>In December 2021, food price inflation was at 5.93%, driven largely by <strong>meat</strong> (8.63%) and <strong>oils</strong> (20.77%). According to BFAP, poultry - a key protein source - became more expensive across most cuts.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Thrifty Healthy Food Basket</strong>, BFAP’s measure of the cost of a balanced diet for a family of four, also rose notably over the year. BFAP described this basket as “a nutritionally balanced combination of 26 food items from all food groups,” offering a more accurate reflection of costs for low-income households than the standard CPI basket.</p>
                <p>Major inflation drivers included the impact of the Omicron variant of <strong>Covid-19</strong>, heavy rainfall that threatened crop production, limited livestock supply, and surging international oilseed prices. Oils and fats remained the most significant contributors to overall food inflation.</p>
